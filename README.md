# Admin-dashbaord

This branch of the admin dash is my attempt to add a dark mode button,
The button functionality is quite simple and some things couldnt be changed (like the side bar icons) because I hadnt made the website originally with the idea to this functinalaty but its stil kinda cool.

their isnt many changes overall, but some minor changes to the css and some javascript addition
